# Testability Project
A quick demo of my knowledge on testing embedded systems
Steps for running this project: 
1. Get c++ code into an executable for the specific arm processor used in 
the application
2. Maybe conduct unit testing using gtest
3. Setup proper target architecture with QEMU, and establish other 
important features
4. Load the compiled executable and run QEMU
5. Debug and proceed, potentially use a debugger such as gdb.
